## Conclusion
Based on all of the evidence, Long is clearly the murderer. Chance's cartel members don't have enough motive to kill him. While Corncob has some motive, Long's motive is stronger. He was angry at Chance for not giving him laktes, as shown by his diary and posts on Twitter. His fingerprints line up with the fingerprints on the murder weapon, and there is a written confession.
